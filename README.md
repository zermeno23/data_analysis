# data_analysis
This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle for my initial efforts in data analysis. 

Goals and Questions:  
My goal for this analysis was to practice what questions I was trying to answer and how I would obtain the results to answers those questions.
I created separate tabs for my questions, raw data, analysis, charts and a pivot table.

My analysis:  
Focused on the averages of many of the numeric variables, while also working on my formulas and functions. I worked with functions: unique(), averageifs(), countifs().

Charts:  
The charts were created to answer some questions on the question tab of the workbook. These were mainly combo charts as I liked how you could compare various variables to spot trends or draw conclusions.

Pivot:  
The pivot tab was created to work through doing some of the same work i did on the analysis tab, without the formulas.
